<H10><p>I was first introduced too fishing by my father when I was around ten years old. My grandfather, who I never met, owned a boat and was an avid fisherman during his life. He taught my dad how to fish and I think my dad wanted the same for me. Since we did't have a boat, my dads limited fishing experience was non transferable too fishing for striped bass from shore. This led too a few fishless fishing trips and to this day I can't remember a fishing trip with my dad where we were actually able to catch anything. As boring as a fishing trip with no fish sounds, this is when my love for fishing began. I enjoyed sitting on the edge of the ocean wondering what was within casting distance and how I could entice the fish that may or may not be there. <p> <H10>
<H10><p>In the years after I learned to fish, I started going with my friends. These trips consisted of grabbing our fishing poles and limited tackle, hopping on our bikes and peddling too the most obvious, overused and accesable spots we could find. This period of my fishing history contains a few more success stories than the early years, but most of the time we would return home with lots of bug bites and no fish to speak of. After multiple fishing seasons filled with mediocre results, I started too become less satisfied with just sitting next to my motionless fishing pole watching the waves crash in front of me. I felt I had put my time in, and wasn't being given the fish I deserved. I started doing research online in hopes that I could gain some knowledge that would yield me the fish of a lifetime I was searching for. <p><H10>
<p> One of the first resources I came across was <a href="http://www.stripersonline.com/surftalk/forum/16-coastal-mainenh-fishing/">Stripersonline.com</a>. An online forum used by fishermen across the united states containing smaller forums and threads organized regionally. One of the first thing I learned was that the way I had been fishing almost guaranteed that I would fail every time. Instead of randomly selecting the easiest and most obvious spots, I should have been constantly trying new locations and using new techniques until I cold see a pattern in terms of where how and when I was catching fish. This new way of thinking about fishing revived my enthusiasm for the sport and sent me into the next season with a full head of steam.<p>  <H1>
