<p> <H1> Surfing is something I love to do, but also recognize I am not very good at. I started surfing with one of my friends and his brother and was given very little instruction to help me succeed. The first few times I went surfing with them, I didn't love it. After a couple times falling and getting tumbled back to shore on crashing waves I managed to get the hang of paddling out and catching the occasional wave. As awkward and unbalanced as I felt, I started to enjoy surfing and being in the ocean on top of my board watching the horizon for incoming swells.  <H1> </p>
