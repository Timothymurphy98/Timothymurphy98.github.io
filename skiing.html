<p> During Winter, My favorite pass time is skiing. When its cold outside there is no better feeling than breaking a sweat after a long run through the woods. The Mountain I spend most of my time skiing at is <a href="http://sundayriver.com">Sunday River</a>. My friends family owns a condo near the mountain so I try to ski as much as I can every weekend. Usually we will ski at least two days a week for six hours.</P>
